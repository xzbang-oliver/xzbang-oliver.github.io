Here, taking built-up areas derived from remote sensing in more than 7000 African agglomerations in 2015 as examples, we systematically investigate this settlement scaling law from continental, regional, and country levels. Results show that the built-up area linearly scales with population across the African continent and within northern and western Africa, while it sub-linearly scales with population in southern (β = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.808–0.891) and central (β = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.906–0.957) Africa, but super-linearly (β = 1.10, 95% CI:1.068–1.121) in eastern Africa. National settlement scaling exponents (β) vary from 0.65 to 1.25 with an average of 0.96, whose 63.6% variance can be explained by their share of built-up area, share of metropolitan population, GDP per capita, and proportion of slum dwellers. Residuals of scaling fitting reflect local population-land tensions. Western and eastern Africa are relatively rich in buildable land resources, while northern Africa is relatively poor. This study expanded the settlement scaling theory in Africa and multiple indicators are needed to further understand the rapidly evolving African urban systems.","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Settlement scaling law reveals population-land tensions in 7000+ African urban agglomerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoqi Duan","Tong Zhang","Zhibang Xu","Qiao Wan","Jinbiao Yan","Wangshu Wang","Youliang Tian"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Recent progress in characterizing urban functional form makes it possible to quantify the relationship between urban functional form and urban carbon emissions. We used urban functional form data from 178 cities of China to study the relationship between urban CO2 emissions and five categories of urban form, compactness, extension, fragmentation, irregularity, and concentration. The results show that all five categories significantly affect the total CO2 emissions (TCE), and four categories (excluding fragmentation) significantly affect per-capita CO2 emissions (PCE). Compactness produces a significant negative effect on both TCE and PCE, for every 1% increase in the functional compactness index (FCI), TCE and PCE decrease by 0.79% and 0.34%, respectively. Carbon-emission-reduction policies should be combined with the topographical environment, spatial structure, and industrial structure of cities. FCI reduces carbon emissions most effectively in plain and single-center cities. The planning and control of forms are more important in hilly and mountainous cities, multi-center cities, and highly industrial cities. This study concludes that the adjustment of urban functional form has important theoretical and practical significance for low-carbon city development.","tags":["Urban Dynamics"],"title":"Considerable role of urban functional form in low-carbon city development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weiqian Lei","Limin Jiao","Zhibang Xu","Gang Xu","Zhengzi Zhou","Xi Luo"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We proposed a theoretical framework of the mechanism of urban development, taking wealth production as an example from the aspects of local, network and systemic dependence to characterize the evolution of cities by temporal persistent trends, network effects and comparative advantages. We first present a detailed description of network dependence and systemic dependence variables to distinguish the differences between hierarchical features of networks based on absolute quantities and the relative performance of individual cities within urban systems. Regression analysis results show that urban economic development relies on its previous performance and presents the characteristic of path dependence. The positive effects of network and systemic variables on urban economic production are significant, especially the closeness centrality and GDP SAMIs (scale-adjusted metropolitan indicator, deriving from urban expected scaling), emphasizing the indispensable impacts of network effects and systemic relative performance on urban economic development. A machine learning algorithm is applied to simulate urban economic development based on the above factors and achieving great performance, which validate the potential and effectiveness of modeling urban development from local, geographical and systemic aspects.

However, the city definition by which the urban boundary is determined is not comparable among different countries. A globally consistent delimitation of hierarchical urban boundaries (HUBs) is rare but urgently needed. In this research, we proposed a model to consistently identify HUBs according to physical urban entity. The main quantitative basis of our model is the density, size and spatial relationship of the artificial impervious surface. We produced a vector dataset of global HUBs (named GHUB) based on 30-meter resolution remote sensing products. Cross-product comparison shows the effectiveness and advantages of our model. We furtherly, for the first time, investigated and compared the physical form and spatial characteristics of global urban settlements through the same lens supported by GHUB. We have identified 10,242 urban settlements with an area above five square kilometers, 39.18% of them are located within 100 km of the coastline. Urban settlements are not the “reinforced concrete forest” as commonly thought. The global average proportion of open space within urban settlements is 41.51%. The total area of urban open space in the world is 279.47 thousand square kilometers. Notably, we verified the Rank-size rule of urban settlement is universal, meanwhile, the verification results of different urban systems in 47 countries show that the Zipf’s exponent varies from country to country. Our work can help to consistently investigate global urban settlements without being affected by various definitions of cities. The GHUB can not only be applied to various urban studies but also can support global affairs such as the Sustainable Development Goal 11 due to its international comparability.","tags":["Urban Dynamics"],"title":"Mapping hierarchical urban boundaries for global urban settlements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weiqian Lei","Limin Jiao","Zhibang Xu","Zhengzi Zhou","Gang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, two cities with the same population size may have vastly different economic outputs, which reveals that factors apart from urban size (a measurement of intra-urban interactions) determine their economic outputs. Economic production is essentially the product of social interactions. Urban population size and interurban interactions reflected by population mobility were both considered to evaluate the scaling of urban economic outputs in this paper. We quantified the scaling relationship between urban economic outputs and interurban interactions, and compared it with the paradigm derived from urban size. Results showed that urban economic outputs scale with urban interactions across cities and present the same super-linear scaling regimes but with a greater scaling exponent. A deeper looking showed that interurban interactions definitely bring a more obvious super-linearity than population size but the scaling relationship between urban size and economic outputs is more robust. Urban population size has a greater impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), secondary and tertiary industries output products, total retail sales of consumer goods and total wage with 60– 65% relative contribution. For exports, interurban interactions and urban population size are almost equally important. We also proved that interactions between cities are significantly positively correlated with urban extra growth. These findings provide convictive evidence that in addition to population size, interurban interaction is also crucial for exploring the scaling of urban growth. Our results are enlightening to the study of mechanisms and evolutions of urban scaling that interurban interaction besides urban population size should both be a vital consideration to urban economic outputs.","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Scaling of urban economic outputs: insights both from urban population size and population mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Limin Jiao","Qiqi Jia","Weiqian Lei","Ting Lan","Rui Zhao","Gang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

For expanding mega-cities, land-use and building function are subject to frequent changes, hence a complete picture of risk profiles is likely to be lacking. Challenges for prevention can be overwhelming for city managers and emergency responders. In this context, we use points of interest (POI) data and multi-time traffic situation (MTS) data to investigate the actual coverage of fire stations in central Beijing under different traffic situations. A method for identifying fire risks of mega cities and optimizing the spatial distribution of fire stations was proposed. First, fire risks associated with distinctive building and land-use functions and their spatial distribution were evaluated using POI data and kernel density analysis. Furthermore, based on the MTS data, a multi-scenario road network was constructed. The “location-allocation” (L-A) model and network analysis were used to map the spatial coverage of the fire stations in the study area, optimized by combining different targets (e.g., coverage of high fire risk areas, important fire risk types). Results show that the top 10% of Beijing’s fire risk areas are concentrated in “Sanlitun-Guomao”, “Ditan-Nanluogu-Wangfujing”, and “Shuangjing-Panjiayuan”, as well as at Beijing Railway Station. Under a quarterly average traffic situation, existing fire stations within the study area exhibit good overall POI coverage (96.51%) within a five-minute response time. However, the coverage in the northwest and southwest, etc. (e.g., Shijicheng and Minzhuang) remain insufficient. On weekdays and weekends, the coverage of fire stations in the morning and evening rush hours fluctuates. Considering the factors of high fire risk areas, major fire risk types, etc. the results of optimization show that 15 additional fire stations are needed to provide sufficient coverage. The methods and results of this research have positive significance for future urban safety planning of mega-cities.","tags":["Urban Resilience and Security"],"title":"Spatial Optimization of Mega-City Fire Stations Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data: A Case Study in Beijing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617148800,"objectID":"c7e1e5f7ff63a31b1887109ef850ce35","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/resourceclass/datasets/","publishdate":"2021-03-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resourceclass/datasets/","section":"resourceclass","summary":"GHUB Vector Data","tags":["data"],"title":"Global Hierarchical Urban Boundaries","type":"resourceclass"},{"authors":["Ting Lan","Guofan Shao","Zhibang Xu","Lina Tang","Lang Sun"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Great efforts have been made to measure urban physical compactness while limited attention has been paid to functional zoning of urban areas.

The FCI does not require the analysis of the grid scale and thus, is technically simpler than conventional compactness index (CI). We examined the effectiveness of FCI on estimating urban compactness under four land use scenarios and in four Chinese cities. The results suggest that, (1) the FCI can comprehensively reflect the intensity of human activity, the differentiation between residential zones and other functional zones, and the mixing degree of different functional zones; (2) the FCI is not affected by the service radius of residential zones; (3) the FCI can reflect the overall and local-scale functional compactness of a city; and (4) the FCI can be used to effectively compare spatial characteristics of functional compactness among different cities. In conclusion, the FCI considers the rationality of urban functional layout, which not only is helpful for urban planning, but also enriches the quantitative methods of urban compactness evaluation..","tags":["Urban Dynamics"],"title":"Measuring urban compactness based on functional characterization and human activity intensity by integrating multiple geospatial data sources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Zhibang Xu","Yanyan Gu","Weiqian Lei","Yupiao Pan","Jie Liu","Limin Jiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The building area has a robust scaling relationship with urban population among different districts in each year, indicating that the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system composed by districts. The scaling exponent between building areas and population in the intra-urban system is less than one (sub-linear relationship), which means building areas increase more slowly than population across districts. Temporally, building areas increase faster than population in most individual districts, showing a super-linear relationship. The contrasting relationship between building area and population across districts and over time indicates that the scaling law cannot be applied in the temporal growth of individual districts or cities. In conclusion, the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system, and the cross-sectional scaling law cannot be applied to individual parts over time.

Within this context, the law of urban scaling reveals the nonlinear scale relationship between urban indicators and urban population, which can be applied to adjust the bias of the raw or the per capita indices used in the measurement of local urban performance at different scales. However, the manner in which the urban scaling law applies to China and how it can be used to assess urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is still unclear. In this study, we employ scale-adjusted metropolitan indicators (SAMIs) to assess ULUE in Chinese cities. We first considered the urban population to calculate the land input performance (LIP) and land output performance (LOP), then we quantify ULUE and identify four related patterns. We further investigate the temporal and spatial variations of ULUE and explore the characteristics and policy implications of ULUE values. Results from our study indicate that ULUE assessments from the perspective of the urban scaling law can effectively correct the bias caused by the urban size, thereby allowing for an objective understanding of performance of cities in different sizes. From 2012 to 2016, ULUE of Chinese cities showed a steadily rising trend. The ULUE patterns of most cities remained unchanged and showed significant “path dependence.” However, the disparity in ULUE between regions is widening. Specifically, the cities in the south are better than those in the north, and the cities in the northeast have significantly deteriorated ULUEs. Some cities showed a high ULUE, especially Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Wuhan. Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggests that geographically neighboring cities are likely to perform similarly regarding ULUE.
