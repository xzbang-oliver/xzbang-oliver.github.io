Although recent large-scale, open-access canopy height models (CHMs) offer potential alternatives to airborne LiDAR, their suitability for urban environments remains uncertain. This study systematically evaluated four prominent CHMs (Potapov, Lang, Tolan, and Malambo) using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data from Washington, D.C., with complementary analyses from four additional cities. We assessed their performance in both canopy classification and height prediction using classification and regression metrics, spatial autocorrelation, consistency tests, and explainable machine learning. Results revealed consistent limitations across products, including widespread misclassification of canopy, systematic tree height prediction biases — characterized by overestimation of low and underestimation of high canopies (the OLUH effect) — and pronounced spatial clustering of errors along urban–forest edges. Among the models, only the Lang CHM passed the Bland–Altman consistency test, showing marginal statistical agreement with reference data. Tree characteristic variables, especially canopy height itself, emerged as dominant drivers of height errors, while topography and built-up context also contributed. Consistent patterns observed across four additional cities indicated that these limitations are systemic rather than location-specific. We conclude that high-precision airborne LiDAR remains essential for urban forestry and recommend enhancing canopy height mapping techniques to better capture the structure of urban trees. A promising direction is the development of urban-specific CHMs with finer spatial and temporal resolution, improved temporal consistency, and integration with high-resolution imagery, contextual deep learning models, and local calibration strategies..","tags":["Urban Ecology"],"title":"High-precision airborne LiDAR remains essential for urban forestry: Revealing the limitations of recent large-scale canopy height products in urban contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756598400,"objectID":"7d41d73b1d033b5e09367b3d5da5c9df","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/projects/ugsu2025/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/ugsu2025/","section":"projects","summary":"NSF2025","tags":["UEco"],"title":"Urban Green Space Utilization","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756598400,"objectID":"a8284b01cedc2d102572558e372206cb","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/projects/ums2025/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/ums2025/","section":"projects","summary":"NSTMP2025","tags":["UEnv"],"title":"Urban Metabolism and Self-purification","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Cui Li","Zhibang Xu","Cuiping Wang","Lei Nie","Haowei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This demographic transition has prompted a strategic shift in urban development from extensive spatial expansion toward quality-oriented, intensive growth models. However, evolving human–land supply–demand dynamics in cities historically characterized by population inflows remain insufficiently understood. This study focuses on Xiamen, a prototypical coastal migrant-receiving city, to investigate land use simulation under demographic transition. By integrating the cohort-component method with the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model, we project Xiamen’s population under three scenarios by 2030, Stable Continuation (SCS), Natural Development (NDS), and National 2030 Population Planning (NPP), with projected increases of 5.56%, 6.76%, and 24.69%, respectively. Results show continued but decelerating population growth, with adequate labor supply and persistent demographic dividend. Notably, the NPP scenario reveals a negative correlation between population growth and construction land expansion. In NPP-High, prioritizing compact development and ecological conservation, population grows by 1.27 million while construction land decreases by 2.85% and forest land increases by 4.09%. This framework provides empirical evidence for compact urban development under the dual constraints of land-use efficiency and ecological protection.","tags":["Urban Land Use"],"title":"Local Land Use Simulation in Migrant-Receiving Xiamen Under National Population Decline: Integrating Cohort-Component and PLUS Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Mengyan Zhu","Bin Chen","Muhammad Salem","Zhibang Xu","Patrick Brandful Cobbinah","Xuecao Li","Neema Simon Sumari","Xiaoling Zhang","Limin Jiao","Peng Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here we show this evolution during 1950–2020 using three urban system rules based on a unified urban definition across the African continent. Zipf’s law quantified increasing population concentration in large cities, leading to a shift from dispersed to centralized city-size distributions. As Gibrat’s law predicted, urban population growth was independent of its initial size since the 1990s. Relative growth among different-sized cities changed urban hierarchy, thus the integration of Zipf’s and Gibrat’s laws uncovered imbalances in urban system structures. The third rule we focus on is the scaling law, where unexpected super-linear scaling relationships between built-up areas and population size indicated lower land-use efficiency in large cities, particularly in Eastern and Western Africa. However, the overall decline in built-up scaling exponents over time suggested improving economies of scale as urban systems matured.

However, the lack of international agreement on city definitions and statistics complicates cross-country comparisons of urban scaling performance. Remote sensing provides a uniform standard for measuring cities around the world. To scrutinize the consistency of UST, we quantified changes in remotely sensed urban built-up areas (UBA) and nighttime lights (NTL) distributions from 11,581 cities in 61 countries spanning 2000–2020, representing urban physical elements and socioeconomic activities, respectively. We find that UBA is well described by UST in all analyzed countries, while NTL aligns with 98% of them. UST quantified by remote sensing shows greater robustness than country-dependent aggregate statistics. We also observed disparities of scaling exponents (β) among countries, with UBA all being sublinear (β \u003c 1), and NTL ranging from 0.46 to 1.22 with a median of 0.94. Both UST and rank-size distributions of urban area and population show stronger scaling relationships for countries with larger networks of built environments, (Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, United States) suggesting that both size and evolution of urban systems impact the underlying scaling processes. Comparison of scaling properties of remotely sensed UBA and NTL captures complementary physical characteristics of built environments while minimizing the Modifiable Area Unit Problem introduced using spatially aggregated metrics within administrative units. Our findings highlight the consistency of urban growth patterns while confirming the systematic socioeconomic disparities among urban systems of varying size and growth trajectory.","tags":["Urban Scaling","Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Global consistency of urban scaling evidenced by remote sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Yiyi Huang","Weiqian Lei","Ting Lan","Haowei Wang","Lei Nie"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Current studies mainly focused on UGS characteristics, paying less attention to their  broader urban system patterns. Few studies explore the multi⁃dimensional features of UGS—such as scale, quality, and  distribution—and their non⁃linear spatiotemporal relationships with urban populations, including count, age, and gender.  Hence, from the perspective of complex systems, this study employs urban scaling theory to analyze the multi⁃dimensional  scaling relationship evolution between UGS and population in Chinese cities using multi⁃source remote sensing and  population data from 2000 to 2020. The characteristic calculations were performed, and further analysis was conducted to  consider scale effects and identify the spatiotemporal patterns of UGS performance. Our results indicate that over the past 20  years, the relationship between UGS and population in Chinese cities has exhibited a consistently robust sub⁃linear scaling relationship, reflecting the economies of scale. The green space scaling exponent steadily increased from 0.497 to 0.614, yet  it remains significantly below the theoretical value of 0. 85, indicating a general insufficiency in the supply of UGS,  particularly for the elderly population aged 60 and above. Notably, there are significant differences in scaling characteristics  among cities with varying quality of green spaces, which deviate from the assumptions of urban scaling theory. The cities  with the highest green space coverage exhibit the most pronounced economies of scale, whereas the scaling characteristics of  cities with medium to high green biomass gradually converge. After accounting for the influence of scale effects, the overall  performance of UGS in China has shown a steady upward trend, accompanied by a significant clustering distribution pattern.  Specifically, the performance of green spaces increasingly exhibits a “ high⁃high” clustering mode, particularly in the region  extending from the North China Plain to the Yangtze River Delta. Our research confirms the widespread presence of sub⁃  linear economies of scale in the evolution of UGS, as well as the spatiotemporal variations in scale economies and local  performance among different populations and cities. In the context of deepening aging and urbanization, this study provides a  decision⁃making basis for better meeting the needs of green space planning and construction in cities of varying scales and  population structures, thereby supporting the achievement of sustainable urban development goals.","tags":["Urban Scaling","Urban Green Space"],"title":"Evolving scaling dynamics between urban green space and population in China from 2000 to 2020(in Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Xiaoqi Duan","Ting Lan","Yashi Wu","Cuiping Wang","Yang Zhong","Haowei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the understanding of the systematic dynamic of UOS scaling with city size and its potential non-linear performance remains a limited clarity area. This study bridges this gap by integrating urban scaling laws with remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020, creating a framework to analyze UOS trends in China. Our findings reveal that UOS growth is sub-linear scaling with city size, exhibiting economies of scale with scaling exponents between 0.55 and 0.65 and suggesting potential shortages. The distribution structure of UOS across cities is becoming increasingly balanced, as indicated by the rising Zipf’s slope from 0.66 to 0.88. Southeastern coastal cities outperform, highlighting spatial variations and path dependency in UOS development. Additionally, using metrics of Scale-adjusted metropolitan indicator (SAMI) and the ratio of open space consumption to population growth rates (OCRPGR), we observe a trend towards more coordinated development between UOS and population, with a declining proportion of uncoordinated cities. Our long-term, large sample coverage study of UOS in China may offer positive significance for urban ecological planning and management in similar rapidly urbanizing countries, contributing to critical insights for quantifying and monitoring urban sustainable development..","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities","Urban Dynamics"],"title":"Tracking the scaling of urban open spaces in China from 1990 to 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Mengyan Zhu","Bin Chen","Muhammad Salem","Zhibang Xu","Xuecao Li","Limin Jiao","Peng Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Recent progress in characterizing urban functional form makes it possible to quantify the relationship between urban functional form and urban carbon emissions. We used urban functional form data from 178 cities of China to study the relationship between urban CO2 emissions and five categories of urban form, compactness, extension, fragmentation, irregularity, and concentration. The results show that all five categories significantly affect the total CO2 emissions (TCE), and four categories (excluding fragmentation) significantly affect per-capita CO2 emissions (PCE). Compactness produces a significant negative effect on both TCE and PCE, for every 1% increase in the functional compactness index (FCI), TCE and PCE decrease by 0.79% and 0.34%, respectively. Carbon-emission-reduction policies should be combined with the topographical environment, spatial structure, and industrial structure of cities. FCI reduces carbon emissions most effectively in plain and single-center cities. The planning and control of forms are more important in hilly and mountainous cities, multi-center cities, and highly industrial cities.

We first present a detailed description of network dependence and systemic dependence variables to distinguish the differences between hierarchical features of networks based on absolute quantities and the relative performance of individual cities within urban systems. Regression analysis results show that urban economic development relies on its previous performance and presents the characteristic of path dependence.

In this research, we proposed a model to consistently identify HUBs according to physical urban entity. The main quantitative basis of our model is the density, size and spatial relationship of the artificial impervious surface. We produced a vector dataset of global HUBs (named GHUB) based on 30-meter resolution remote sensing products. Cross-product comparison shows the effectiveness and advantages of our model. We furtherly, for the first time, investigated and compared the physical form and spatial characteristics of global urban settlements through the same lens supported by GHUB. We have identified 10,242 urban settlements with an area above five square kilometers, 39.18% of them are located within 100 km of the coastline. Urban settlements are not the “reinforced concrete forest” as commonly thought. The global average proportion of open space within urban settlements is 41.51%. The total area of urban open space in the world is 279.47 thousand square kilometers. Notably, we verified the Rank-size rule of urban settlement is universal, meanwhile, the verification results of different urban systems in 47 countries show that the Zipf’s exponent varies from country to country.

However, two cities with the same population size may have vastly different economic outputs, which reveals that factors apart from urban size (a measurement of intra-urban interactions) determine their economic outputs. Economic production is essentially the product of social interactions. Urban population size and interurban interactions reflected by population mobility were both considered to evaluate the scaling of urban economic outputs in this paper. We quantified the scaling relationship between urban economic outputs and interurban interactions, and compared it with the paradigm derived from urban size. Results showed that urban economic outputs scale with urban interactions across cities and present the same super-linear scaling regimes but with a greater scaling exponent. A deeper looking showed that interurban interactions definitely bring a more obvious super-linearity than population size but the scaling relationship between urban size and economic outputs is more robust. Urban population size has a greater impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), secondary and tertiary industries output products, total retail sales of consumer goods and total wage with 60– 65% relative contribution. For exports, interurban interactions and urban population size are almost equally important. We also proved that interactions between cities are significantly positively correlated with urban extra growth. These findings provide convictive evidence that in addition to population size, interurban interaction is also crucial for exploring the scaling of urban growth. Our results are enlightening to the study of mechanisms and evolutions of urban scaling that interurban interaction besides urban population size should both be a vital consideration to urban economic outputs.","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Scaling of urban economic outputs: insights both from urban population size and population mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Limin Jiao","Qiqi Jia","Weiqian Lei","Ting Lan","Rui Zhao","Gang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

For expanding mega-cities, land-use and building function are subject to frequent changes, hence a complete picture of risk profiles is likely to be lacking. Challenges for prevention can be overwhelming for city managers and emergency responders. In this context, we use points of interest (POI) data and multi-time traffic situation (MTS) data to investigate the actual coverage of fire stations in central Beijing under different traffic situations. A method for identifying fire risks of mega cities and optimizing the spatial distribution of fire stations was proposed. First, fire risks associated with distinctive building and land-use functions and their spatial distribution were evaluated using POI data and kernel density analysis. Furthermore, based on the MTS data, a multi-scenario road network was constructed. The “location-allocation” (L-A) model and network analysis were used to map the spatial coverage of the fire stations in the study area, optimized by combining different targets (e.g., coverage of high fire risk areas, important fire risk types). Results show that the top 10% of Beijing’s fire risk areas are concentrated in “Sanlitun-Guomao”, “Ditan-Nanluogu-Wangfujing”, and “Shuangjing-Panjiayuan”, as well as at Beijing Railway Station. Under a quarterly average traffic situation, existing fire stations within the study area exhibit good overall POI coverage (96.51%) within a five-minute response time. However, the coverage in the northwest and southwest, etc. (e.g., Shijicheng and Minzhuang) remain insufficient. On weekdays and weekends, the coverage of fire stations in the morning and evening rush hours fluctuates. Considering the factors of high fire risk areas, major fire risk types, etc. the results of optimization show that 15 additional fire stations are needed to provide sufficient coverage. The methods and results of this research have positive significance for future urban safety planning of mega-cities.","tags":["Urban Resilience and Security"],"title":"Spatial Optimization of Mega-City Fire Stations Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data: A Case Study in Beijing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617148800,"objectID":"c7e1e5f7ff63a31b1887109ef850ce35","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/resourceclass/datasets/","publishdate":"2021-03-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resourceclass/datasets/","section":"resourceclass","summary":"GHUB Vector Data","tags":["data"],"title":"Global Hierarchical Urban Boundaries","type":"resourceclass"},{"authors":["Ting Lan","Guofan Shao","Zhibang Xu","Lina Tang","Lang Sun"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Great efforts have been made to measure urban physical compactness while limited attention has been paid to functional zoning of urban areas. Here, we introduce a novel index, called the functional compactness index (FCI), to quantify urban functional compactness through the integration of geospatial data sources, including Points of Interest (POIs) data, Road Network of OpenStreetMap (RNO) data, and National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data. The FCI does not require the analysis of the grid scale and thus, is technically simpler than conventional compactness index (CI). We examined the effectiveness of FCI on estimating urban compactness under four land use scenarios and in four Chinese cities. The results suggest that, (1) the FCI can comprehensively reflect the intensity of human activity, the differentiation between residential zones and other functional zones, and the mixing degree of different functional zones; (2) the FCI is not affected by the service radius of residential zones; (3) the FCI can reflect the overall and local-scale functional compactness of a city; and (4) the FCI can be used to effectively compare spatial characteristics of functional compactness among different cities. In conclusion, the FCI considers the rationality of urban functional layout, which not only is helpful for urban planning, but also enriches the quantitative methods of urban compactness evaluation..","tags":["Urban Dynamics"],"title":"Measuring urban compactness based on functional characterization and human activity intensity by integrating multiple geospatial data sources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Zhibang Xu","Yanyan Gu","Weiqian Lei","Yupiao Pan","Jie Liu","Limin Jiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, whether the scaling law also exists in an intra-urban system and whether the scaling law across cities can be applied in the temporal growth of individual cities are not clear. Taking Shanghai, China, as an example, we collected urban population, building areas and other urban indicators from 2005 to 2017 in districts (the secondary administrative unit of Chinese cities). The building area has a robust scaling relationship with urban population among different districts in each year, indicating that the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system composed by districts. The scaling exponent between building areas and population in the intra-urban system is less than one (sub-linear relationship), which means building areas increase more slowly than population across districts. Temporally, building areas increase faster than population in most individual districts, showing a super-linear relationship. The contrasting relationship between building area and population across districts and over time indicates that the scaling law cannot be applied in the temporal growth of individual districts or cities. In conclusion, the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system, and the cross-sectional scaling law cannot be applied to individual parts over time. Our further analyses using GDP and other five urban indicators confirm the two findings.","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Scaling laws in intra-urban systems and over time at the district level in Shanghai, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Limin Jiao","Zhibang Xu","Gang Xu","Rui Zhao","Jiafeng Liu","Weilin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Within this context, the law of urban scaling reveals the nonlinear scale relationship between urban indicators and urban population, which can be applied to adjust the bias of the raw or the per capita indices used in the measurement of local urban performance at different scales. However, the manner in which the urban scaling law applies to China and how it can be used to assess urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is still unclear. In this study, we employ scale-adjusted metropolitan indicators (SAMIs) to assess ULUE in Chinese cities. We first considered the urban population to calculate the land input performance (LIP) and land output performance (LOP), then we quantify ULUE and identify four related patterns. We further investigate the temporal and spatial variations of ULUE and explore the characteristics and policy implications of ULUE values. Results from our study indicate that ULUE assessments from the perspective of the urban scaling law can effectively correct the bias caused by the urban size, thereby allowing for an objective understanding of performance of cities in different sizes. From 2012 to 2016, ULUE of Chinese cities showed a steadily rising trend. The ULUE patterns of most cities remained unchanged and showed significant “path dependence.” However, the disparity in ULUE between regions is widening. Specifically, the cities in the south are better than those in the north, and the cities in the northeast have significantly deteriorated ULUEs. Some cities showed a high ULUE, especially Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Wuhan. Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggests that geographically neighboring cities are likely to perform similarly regarding ULUE. In terms of policy implications, our work can provide a clear direction for development of cities in urban size and urban efficiency..","tags":["Complex Systems of Cities"],"title":"Assessment of urban land use efficiency in China: A perspective of scaling law","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weilin Wang","Limin Jiao","Ting Dong","Zhibang Xu","Gang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Coupling top-down and bottom-up CA models are often used to address macro-scale demand and micro-scale allocation in the simulation of urban dynamics. However, those models typically ignore spatial differences in terms of the coupling process between macro-scale demand and micro-scale allocation. Herein, a novel approach for combining top-down and bottom-up strategies based on simulating urban dynamics is proposed. An optimizing strategy was used to predict the parameter of the inverse S-shaped function of future urban land use pattern and further deduce urban land increment within each concentric ring. The maximum probability transformation rule was incorporated into the CA model to address the micro-scale allocation. Wuhan was selected to test the performance of the proposed approach, and the conventional and the proposed approaches were compared. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach can not only retain the model’s accuracies but also better simulate the macro morphology of urban development dynamics and generate more realistic urban dynamic pattern in the urban sub-center and fringe regions. The proposed coupling approach can also be used to generate different development scenarios.
