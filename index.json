The main focus of the research is the difference in statistical cognition of urban expansion between the administrative unit perspective and the natural city perspective, involving the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) in geography. This work is helpful to deepen the understanding of the spatiotemporal process of Chinaâ€™s land urbanization and provide decision support for scientific land resource management.\nrelated article\nDuring the oral presentation ","date":1694941200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694941200,"objectID":"774b820949b7b129678393e2c2aed3ce","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/event/oral0917/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/oral0917/","section":"event","summary":"Presented research on urban expansion in China.","tags":["ACUG"],"title":"Oral presentation at the Chinese ACUG 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Limin Jiao","Yu Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
