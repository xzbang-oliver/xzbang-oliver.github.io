This demographic transition has prompted a strategic shift in urban development from extensive spatial expansion toward quality-oriented, intensive growth models. However, evolving human–land supply–demand dynamics in cities historically characterized by population inflows remain insufficiently understood. This study focuses on Xiamen, a prototypical coastal migrant-receiving city, to investigate land use simulation under demographic transition. By integrating the cohort-component method with the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model, we project Xiamen’s population under three scenarios by 2030, Stable Continuation (SCS), Natural Development (NDS), and National 2030 Population Planning (NPP), with projected increases of 5.56%, 6.76%, and 24.69%, respectively. Results show continued but decelerating population growth, with adequate labor supply and persistent demographic dividend. Notably, the NPP scenario reveals a negative correlation between population growth and construction land expansion. In NPP-High, prioritizing compact development and ecological conservation, population grows by 1.27 million while construction land decreases by 2.85% and forest land increases by 4.09%. This framework provides empirical evidence for compact urban development under the dual constraints of land-use efficiency and ecological protection.","tags":["城市土地利用","人口负增长","厦门市"],"title":"Local Land Use Simulation in Migrant-Receiving Xiamen Under National Population Decline: Integrating Cohort-Component and PLUS Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibang Xu","Gang Xu","Ting Lan","Xi Li","Zuoqi Chen","Hao Cui","Zhengzi Zhou","Haowei Wang","Limin Jiao","Christopher Small"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the lack of international agreement on city definitions and statistics complicates cross-country comparisons of urban scaling performance. Remote sensing provides a uniform standard for measuring cities around the world. To scrutinize the consistency of UST, we quantified changes in remotely sensed urban built-up areas (UBA) and nighttime lights (NTL) distributions from 11,581 cities in 61 countries spanning 2000–2020, representing urban physical elements and socioeconomic activities, respectively. We find that UBA is well described by UST in all analyzed countries, while NTL aligns with 98% of them. UST quantified by remote sensing shows greater robustness than country-dependent aggregate statistics. We also observed disparities of scaling exponents (β) among countries, with UBA all being sublinear (β \u003c 1), and NTL ranging from 0.46 to 1.22 with a median of 0.94. Both UST and rank-size distributions of urban area and population show stronger scaling relationships for countries with larger networks of built environments, (Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, United States) suggesting that both size and evolution of urban systems impact the underlying scaling processes. Comparison of scaling properties of remotely sensed UBA and NTL captures complementary physical characteristics of built environments while minimizing the Modifiable Area Unit Problem introduced using spatially aggregated metrics within administrative units. Our findings highlight the consistency of urban growth patterns while confirming the systematic socioeconomic disparities among urban systems of varying size and growth trajectory.","tags":["城市标度律","城市复杂系统","全球城市"],"title":"Global consistency of urban scaling evidenced by remote sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐智邦","黄毅熠","雷玮倩","蓝婷","王豪伟","聂镭"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the understanding of the systematic dynamic of UOS scaling with city size and its potential non-linear performance remains a limited clarity area. This study bridges this gap by integrating urban scaling laws with remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020, creating a framework to analyze UOS trends in China. Our findings reveal that UOS growth is sub-linear scaling with city size, exhibiting economies of scale with scaling exponents between 0.55 and 0.65 and suggesting potential shortages. The distribution structure of UOS across cities is becoming increasingly balanced, as indicated by the rising Zipf’s slope from 0.66 to 0.88. Southeastern coastal cities outperform, highlighting spatial variations and path dependency in UOS development. Additionally, using metrics of Scale-adjusted metropolitan indicator (SAMI) and the ratio of open space consumption to population growth rates (OCRPGR), we observe a trend towards more coordinated development between UOS and population, with a declining proportion of uncoordinated cities. Our long-term, large sample coverage study of UOS in China may offer positive significance for urban ecological planning and management in similar rapidly urbanizing countries, contributing to critical insights for quantifying and monitoring urban sustainable development..","tags":["城市标度律","城市绿地","城市土地利用"],"title":"Tracking the scaling of urban open spaces in China from 1990 to 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Mengyan Zhu","Bin Chen","Muhammad Salem","Zhibang Xu","Xuecao Li","Limin Jiao","Peng Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here, taking built-up areas derived from remote sensing in more than 7000 African agglomerations in 2015 as examples, we systematically investigate this settlement scaling law from continental, regional, and country levels. Results show that the built-up area linearly scales with population across the African continent and within northern and western Africa, while it sub-linearly scales with population in southern (β = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.808–0.891) and central (β = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.906–0.957) Africa, but super-linearly (β = 1.10, 95% CI:1.068–1.121) in eastern Africa. National settlement scaling exponents (β) vary from 0.65 to 1.25 with an average of 0.96, whose 63.6% variance can be explained by their share of built-up area, share of metropolitan population, GDP per capita, and proportion of slum dwellers. Residuals of scaling fitting reflect local population-land tensions. Western and eastern Africa are relatively rich in buildable land resources, while northern Africa is relatively poor. This study expanded the settlement scaling theory in Africa and multiple indicators are needed to further understand the rapidly evolving African urban systems.","tags":["城市复杂系统"],"title":"Settlement scaling law reveals population-land tensions in 7000+ African urban agglomerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"63b912aa8f2381180d8ad6d4a3dba1d5","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/zh/projects/uenp2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/projects/uenp2023/","section":"projects","summary":"福建省自然科学基金项目2023","tags":["UGeo"],"title":"网络视角下的城市扩张","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"47289d7c3ea5cde34eac124caa5e8162","permalink":"https://xzbang.top/zh/projects/uesp2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/projects/uesp2023/","section":"projects","summary":"厦门市自然科学基金项目2023","tags":["UGeo"],"title":"人口负增长下的城市扩张","type":"projects"},{"authors":["徐智邦","焦利民","王玉"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the city definition by which the urban boundary is determined is not comparable among different countries. A globally consistent delimitation of hierarchical urban boundaries (HUBs) is rare but urgently needed. In this research, we proposed a model to consistently identify HUBs according to physical urban entity. The main quantitative basis of our model is the density, size and spatial relationship of the artificial impervious surface. We produced a vector dataset of global HUBs (named GHUB) based on 30-meter resolution remote sensing products. Cross-product comparison shows the effectiveness and advantages of our model. We furtherly, for the first time, investigated and compared the physical form and spatial characteristics of global urban settlements through the same lens supported by GHUB. We have identified 10,242 urban settlements with an area above five square kilometers, 39.18% of them are located within 100 km of the coastline. Urban settlements are not the “reinforced concrete forest” as commonly thought. The global average proportion of open space within urban settlements is 41.51%. The total area of urban open space in the world is 279.47 thousand square kilometers. Notably, we verified the Rank-size rule of urban settlement is universal, meanwhile, the verification results of different urban systems in 47 countries show that the Zipf’s exponent varies from country to country. Our work can help to consistently investigate global urban settlements without being affected by various definitions of cities. The GHUB can not only be applied to various urban studies but also can support global affairs such as the Sustainable Development Goal 11 due to its international comparability.","tags":["城市地域功能演化"],"title":"Mapping hierarchical urban boundaries for global urban settlements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐智邦","焦利民","贾琦琪","雷玮倩","蓝婷","赵睿","许刚"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

For expanding mega-cities, land-use and building function are subject to frequent changes, hence a complete picture of risk profiles is likely to be lacking. Challenges for prevention can be overwhelming for city managers and emergency responders. In this context, we use points of interest (POI) data and multi-time traffic situation (MTS) data to investigate the actual coverage of fire stations in central Beijing under different traffic situations. A method for identifying fire risks of mega cities and optimizing the spatial distribution of fire stations was proposed. First, fire risks associated with distinctive building and land-use functions and their spatial distribution were evaluated using POI data and kernel density analysis. Furthermore, based on the MTS data, a multi-scenario road network was constructed. The “location-allocation” (L-A) model and network analysis were used to map the spatial coverage of the fire stations in the study area, optimized by combining different targets (e.g., coverage of high fire risk areas, important fire risk types). Results show that the top 10% of Beijing’s fire risk areas are concentrated in “Sanlitun-Guomao”, “Ditan-Nanluogu-Wangfujing”, and “Shuangjing-Panjiayuan”, as well as at Beijing Railway Station. Under a quarterly average traffic situation, existing fire stations within the study area exhibit good overall POI coverage (96.51%) within a five-minute response time. However, the coverage in the northwest and southwest, etc. (e.g., Shijicheng and Minzhuang) remain insufficient. On weekdays and weekends, the coverage of fire stations in the morning and evening rush hours fluctuates. Considering the factors of high fire risk areas, major fire risk types, etc. the results of optimization show that 15 additional fire stations are needed to provide sufficient coverage. The methods and results of this research have positive significance for future urban safety planning of mega-cities.","tags":["城市韧性与生态安全"],"title":"Spatial Optimization of Mega-City Fire Stations Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data: A Case Study in Beijing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Zhibang Xu","Yanyan Gu","Weiqian Lei","Yupiao Pan","Jie Liu","Limin Jiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The building area has a robust scaling relationship with urban population among different districts in each year, indicating that the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system composed by districts. The scaling exponent between building areas and population in the intra-urban system is less than one (sub-linear relationship), which means building areas increase more slowly than population across districts. Temporally, building areas increase faster than population in most individual districts, showing a super-linear relationship. The contrasting relationship between building area and population across districts and over time indicates that the scaling law cannot be applied in the temporal growth of individual districts or cities. In conclusion, the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system, and the cross-sectional scaling law cannot be applied to individual parts over time.

Within this context, the law of urban scaling reveals the nonlinear scale relationship between urban indicators and urban population, which can be applied to adjust the bias of the raw or the per capita indices used in the measurement of local urban performance at different scales. However, the manner in which the urban scaling law applies to China and how it can be used to assess urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is still unclear. In this study, we employ scale-adjusted metropolitan indicators (SAMIs) to assess ULUE in Chinese cities. We first considered the urban population to calculate the land input performance (LIP) and land output performance (LOP), then we quantify ULUE and identify four related patterns. We further investigate the temporal and spatial variations of ULUE and explore the characteristics and policy implications of ULUE values. Results from our study indicate that ULUE assessments from the perspective of the urban scaling law can effectively correct the bias caused by the urban size, thereby allowing for an objective understanding of performance of cities in different sizes. From 2012 to 2016, ULUE of Chinese cities showed a steadily rising trend. The ULUE patterns of most cities remained unchanged and showed significant “path dependence.” However, the disparity in ULUE between regions is widening. Specifically, the cities in the south are better than those in the north, and the cities in the northeast have significantly deteriorated ULUEs. Some cities showed a high ULUE, especially Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Wuhan.
