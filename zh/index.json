However, the understanding of the systematic dynamic of UOS scaling with city size and its potential non-linear performance remains a limited clarity area. This study bridges this gap by integrating urban scaling laws with remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020, creating a framework to analyze UOS trends in China. Our findings reveal that UOS growth is sub-linear scaling with city size, exhibiting economies of scale with scaling exponents between 0.55 and 0.65 and suggesting potential shortages. The distribution structure of UOS across cities is becoming increasingly balanced, as indicated by the rising Zipf’s slope from 0.66 to 0.88. Southeastern coastal cities outperform, highlighting spatial variations and path dependency in UOS development. Additionally, using metrics of Scale-adjusted metropolitan indicator (SAMI) and the ratio of open space consumption to population growth rates (OCRPGR), we observe a trend towards more coordinated development between UOS and population, with a declining proportion of uncoordinated cities. Our long-term, large sample coverage study of UOS in China may offer positive significance for urban ecological planning and management in similar rapidly urbanizing countries, contributing to critical insights for quantifying and monitoring urban sustainable development..","tags":["城市地域功能演化"],"title":"Tracking the scaling of urban open spaces in China from 1990 to 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Mengyan Zhu","Bin Chen","Muhammad Salem","Zhibang Xu","Xuecao Li","Limin Jiao","Peng Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here, taking built-up areas derived from remote sensing in more than 7000 African agglomerations in 2015 as examples, we systematically investigate this settlement scaling law from continental, regional, and country levels. Results show that the built-up area linearly scales with population across the African continent and within northern and western Africa, while it sub-linearly scales with population in southern (β = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.808–0.891) and central (β = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.906–0.957) Africa, but super-linearly (β = 1.10, 95% CI:1.068–1.121) in eastern Africa. National settlement scaling exponents (β) vary from 0.65 to 1.25 with an average of 0.96, whose 63.6% variance can be explained by their share of built-up area, share of metropolitan population, GDP per capita, and proportion of slum dwellers. Residuals of scaling fitting reflect local population-land tensions. Western and eastern Africa are relatively rich in buildable land resources, while northern Africa is relatively poor. This study expanded the settlement scaling theory in Africa and multiple indicators are needed to further understand the rapidly evolving African urban systems.","tags":["城市复杂系统"],"title":"Settlement scaling law reveals population-land tensions in 7000+ African urban agglomerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐智邦","焦利民","王玉"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the city definition by which the urban boundary is determined is not comparable among different countries. A globally consistent delimitation of hierarchical urban boundaries (HUBs) is rare but urgently needed. In this research, we proposed a model to consistently identify HUBs according to physical urban entity. The main quantitative basis of our model is the density, size and spatial relationship of the artificial impervious surface. We produced a vector dataset of global HUBs (named GHUB) based on 30-meter resolution remote sensing products. Cross-product comparison shows the effectiveness and advantages of our model. We furtherly, for the first time, investigated and compared the physical form and spatial characteristics of global urban settlements through the same lens supported by GHUB. We have identified 10,242 urban settlements with an area above five square kilometers, 39.18% of them are located within 100 km of the coastline. Urban settlements are not the “reinforced concrete forest” as commonly thought. The global average proportion of open space within urban settlements is 41.51%. The total area of urban open space in the world is 279.47 thousand square kilometers. Notably, we verified the Rank-size rule of urban settlement is universal, meanwhile, the verification results of different urban systems in 47 countries show that the Zipf’s exponent varies from country to country. Our work can help to consistently investigate global urban settlements without being affected by various definitions of cities. The GHUB can not only be applied to various urban studies but also can support global affairs such as the Sustainable Development Goal 11 due to its international comparability.","tags":["城市地域功能演化"],"title":"Mapping hierarchical urban boundaries for global urban settlements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐智邦","焦利民","贾琦琪","雷玮倩","蓝婷","赵睿","许刚"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

For expanding mega-cities, land-use and building function are subject to frequent changes, hence a complete picture of risk profiles is likely to be lacking. Challenges for prevention can be overwhelming for city managers and emergency responders. In this context, we use points of interest (POI) data and multi-time traffic situation (MTS) data to investigate the actual coverage of fire stations in central Beijing under different traffic situations. A method for identifying fire risks of mega cities and optimizing the spatial distribution of fire stations was proposed. First, fire risks associated with distinctive building and land-use functions and their spatial distribution were evaluated using POI data and kernel density analysis. Furthermore, based on the MTS data, a multi-scenario road network was constructed. The “location-allocation” (L-A) model and network analysis were used to map the spatial coverage of the fire stations in the study area, optimized by combining different targets (e.g., coverage of high fire risk areas, important fire risk types). Results show that the top 10% of Beijing’s fire risk areas are concentrated in “Sanlitun-Guomao”, “Ditan-Nanluogu-Wangfujing”, and “Shuangjing-Panjiayuan”, as well as at Beijing Railway Station. Under a quarterly average traffic situation, existing fire stations within the study area exhibit good overall POI coverage (96.51%) within a five-minute response time. However, the coverage in the northwest and southwest, etc. (e.g., Shijicheng and Minzhuang) remain insufficient. On weekdays and weekends, the coverage of fire stations in the morning and evening rush hours fluctuates. Considering the factors of high fire risk areas, major fire risk types, etc. the results of optimization show that 15 additional fire stations are needed to provide sufficient coverage. The methods and results of this research have positive significance for future urban safety planning of mega-cities.","tags":["城市韧性与生态安全"],"title":"Spatial Optimization of Mega-City Fire Stations Based on Multi-Source Geospatial Data: A Case Study in Beijing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Xu","Zhibang Xu","Yanyan Gu","Weiqian Lei","Yupiao Pan","Jie Liu","Limin Jiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, whether the scaling law also exists in an intra-urban system and whether the scaling law across cities can be applied in the temporal growth of individual cities are not clear. Taking Shanghai, China, as an example, we collected urban population, building areas and other urban indicators from 2005 to 2017 in districts (the secondary administrative unit of Chinese cities). The building area has a robust scaling relationship with urban population among different districts in each year, indicating that the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system composed by districts. The scaling exponent between building areas and population in the intra-urban system is less than one (sub-linear relationship), which means building areas increase more slowly than population across districts. Temporally, building areas increase faster than population in most individual districts, showing a super-linear relationship. The contrasting relationship between building area and population across districts and over time indicates that the scaling law cannot be applied in the temporal growth of individual districts or cities. In conclusion, the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system, and the cross-sectional scaling law cannot be applied to individual parts over time. Our further analyses using GDP and other five urban indicators confirm the two findings.","tags":["城市复杂系统"],"title":"Scaling laws in intra-urban systems and over time at the district level in Shanghai, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Limin Jiao","Zhibang Xu","Gang Xu","Rui Zhao","Jiafeng Liu","Weilin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Within this context, the law of urban scaling reveals the nonlinear scale relationship between urban indicators and urban population, which can be applied to adjust the bias of the raw or the per capita indices used in the measurement of local urban performance at different scales. However, the manner in which the urban scaling law applies to China and how it can be used to assess urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is still unclear. In this study, we employ scale-adjusted metropolitan indicators (SAMIs) to assess ULUE in Chinese cities. We first considered the urban population to calculate the land input performance (LIP) and land output performance (LOP), then we quantify ULUE and identify four related patterns. We further investigate the temporal and spatial variations of ULUE and explore the characteristics and policy implications of ULUE values. Results from our study indicate that ULUE assessments from the perspective of the urban scaling law can effectively correct the bias caused by the urban size, thereby allowing for an objective understanding of performance of cities in different sizes. From 2012 to 2016, ULUE of Chinese cities showed a steadily rising trend. The ULUE patterns of most cities remained unchanged and showed significant “path dependence.” However, the disparity in ULUE between regions is widening. Specifically, the cities in the south are better than those in the north, and the cities in the northeast have significantly deteriorated ULUEs. Some cities showed a high ULUE, especially Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Wuhan. Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggests that geographically neighboring cities are likely to perform similarly regarding ULUE. In terms of policy implications, our work can provide a clear direction for development of cities in urban size and urban efficiency..","tags":["城市复杂系统"],"title":"Assessment of urban land use efficiency in China: A perspective of scaling law","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐智邦","周亮","蓝婷","王中辉","孙立","武荣伟"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
